# Student Management System

## Description
This project involves the development of a comprehensive Student Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. The application is designed based on a UML class model that manages students, professors, and courses, implementing key concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. The system features a text-based interface that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various entities, including students, professors, and courses. The program is structured to support multiple user roles with different access levels, ensuring that all functionalities are accessible depending on the user's credentials.

The application begins with a main menu offering options to manage the system, access user information, or exit. The management menu allows detailed operations on users, students, professors, and courses, including creating, editing, and deleting records, as well as associating students and professors with courses. The project demonstrates a strong application of OOP, with each class and method carefully designed to ensure modularity, reusability, and scalability.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Utilizes C++ OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Text-Based Interface:** A simple, intuitive interface for managing students, professors, and courses.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Multiple user roles with different access levels ensure secure and appropriate access to system functionalities.
- **CRUD Operations:** Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records for students, professors, and courses.
- **Modular and Scalable:** The system is designed for easy expansion and integration with additional features or modules.

## How to Run
1. Compile the C++ source code using a compatible compiler.
2. Run the executable from the command line.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate the system and perform various operations.

## UML Class Diagram
The project is built on a UML class model, which serves as the blueprint for the application structure.

## Usage
Upon starting the application, the main menu provides options to:
- Manage the system (students, professors, courses).
- Access user information.
- Exit the program.

### Management Menu Options
- **Create:** Add new students, professors, or courses.
- **Read:** View details of existing records.
- **Update:** Modify existing records.
- **Delete:** Remove records from the system.
- **Associate:** Link students and professors to courses.

## Conclusion
This Student Management System showcases the practical application of OOP principles in C++ and serves as a foundation for more complex systems. The text-based interface provides a straightforward way to manage educational entities, making the system both powerful and easy to use.
